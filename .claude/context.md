# Perplexity Agent - Project Context

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-31T13:27:57.910734

## Current Sprint & Focus Areas
*Initial project setup and core architecture definition*
- Project scaffolding and basic structure
- Core AI/ML agent implementation
- Integration planning with external APIs
- Development environment setup
- Basic functionality proof-of-concept

## Architecture Overview
- **Language:** Python (recommended for AI/ML projects)
- **Framework:** To be determined (suggest: LangChain, AutoGPT, or custom framework)
- **Project Type:** AI Agent System
- **Primary Function:** Intelligent query processing and response generation

## Project Description
Perplexity Agent appears to be an AI-powered agent system designed to process complex queries and generate intelligent responses. The project likely focuses on natural language understanding and generation capabilities, potentially leveraging large language models to provide contextual, accurate information to users.

Given the name "perplexity-agent," it may involve measuring or optimizing for response quality using perplexity metrics, or it could be designed to handle ambiguous or complex user queries that traditional systems might find "perplexing." The agent probably incorporates reasoning capabilities and may integrate with external knowledge sources or APIs to enhance response accuracy.

## Recent Changes
- **Initial Generation:** Project context file created
- **Project Setup:** Basic documentation structure established
- **Architecture Planning:** Initial technical direction defined

## Current Blockers
- No active blockers identified
- Awaiting project requirements and detailed specifications
- Need to determine specific AI/ML models and frameworks

## Next Steps
1. **Define Core Requirements**
   - Specify primary use cases and target users
   - Determine key functionality (query processing, response generation, etc.)
   - Identify integration points with external systems/APIs

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Initialize version control repository
   - Create Python virtual environment with required dependencies
   - Set up testing framework and CI/CD pipeline

3. **Implement Core Agent Architecture**
   - Create basic agent class structure
   - Integrate with chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.)
   - Implement prompt engineering and response handling

4. **Build Basic User Interface**
   - Create CLI interface for initial testing
   - Plan for future web interface or API endpoints
   - Implement basic input/output handling

## Development Workflow
1. **Branch Strategy:** Use feature branches from main
2. **Testing:** Implement unit tests for core functionality
3. **Documentation:** Maintain updated context.md and technical docs
4. **Code Review:** Required before merging to main
5. **Deployment:** Set up staging environment for testing

## Notes
- Project name suggests focus on handling complex/ambiguous queries
- Consider starting with a simple prototype using existing LLM APIs
- Evaluate whether to build custom models or leverage existing ones
- Plan for scalability and potential multi-agent architecture
- Consider ethical implications and response validation mechanisms
